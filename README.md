This model adops as annual time step and, for a given check dam system (dams' location and storage capacity) in the stream path of a catchment, calculates as output the annual changes in the dams' storage capacity (due to sediment trapping), the annual values of the Sediment Delivery Ratio (ratio between the annual amount of sediment discharged at the catchment's outlet and delivered to the stream path), and the life expectancy of each check dam.
